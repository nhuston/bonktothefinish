After a last minute sign up for the [Dawg Gone Long Run](/blog/dawg-gone-long-run.html), I ended up taking home a malnourished stray cat. Suddenly there was a rush to find names for the new found cat. Given her vet appointments being top priority, it took about 6 days before she had an official name. In the meantime I defaulted to “Kitty,” even though the vet said she is over a year old and not a kitten. I even reached out to friends on social media to get some additional ideas.

###Based on the location/finding of the found cat:

1. Caesar (found at [Caesar Creek State Park](http://www.caesarcreekstatepark.com/)) <br/>
2. Lucky

###Russian theme (due to us thinking cat looked like a Russian blue mix):

3. Anastasiya <br/>
4. Elza <br/>
5. Haze <br/>
6. Nala <br/>
7. Meisha <br/>
8. Zoya

###Animal Theme

9. Elephant (Ellie for short) <br/>
10. Koala <br/>
11. Hippo <br/>
12. Rhino (Rye for short)

###Due to Grey coloring:

13. Haze <br/>
14. Storm

###Greek names (using the name Caesar as inspiration):

15. [Idunn](http://www.goddess-guide.com/idunn.html): Goddess of youth and springtime <br/>
16. Leia

###Other:

17. Altra/Ultra <br/>
18. Callie <br/>
19. Delilah <br/>
20. Katniss <br/>
21. Kitty (the easy way out) <br/>
22. Kylo <br/>
23. Nip (from Catnip) <br/>
24. Tulip <br/>
25. Twisty <br/>
26. Twix <br/>
27. Pez <br/>
28. Ray/Rey <br/>
29. Ren <br/>
30. Violet

##And the winner is…. <br/>
Rye! Based on Rhino. The background to the name is funny but the nickname is normal enough to work as a cat name.
