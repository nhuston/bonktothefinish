I own several pairs of full length compression tights but this was my first time owning both the Skins brand compression tights and 3/4 length tights.

The tights themselves were more breathable than I expected.
We've had a long summer in Ohio and I found these to be breathable enough to wear in 70-85 degree temps without feeling like my legs were drenched.
But lately temperatures have been slightly more bareable and I am finding that the length and thickness are overall best suited for spring/fall weather.

Out of the package the compression tights initally appear way too small, but fear not!
I used the sizing table online and found them to be very true to size.
The material was stretchy.
The biggest thing I've been doing to extend the life of the compression is not putting them in the dryer.
Given the elasticity and quick drying of the material the dryer isn't really necessary anyways.

Now, I wore these pants to several races and have found that I am not a fan of wearing compression tights to shorter races.
These tights have a higher waistband and I found in shorter races that it made me feel like I needed to pee the entire time.
This was during a 4 miler and 10k.
I didn't notice this at all during normal runs or at a half marathon when I wore them.
So that's just my word of caution but who knows if that's a normal issue or just me.

Another thing I loved about these tights was the reflective patches.
The reflective patches blend in with the black on the pants which I like.
However, when a light is reflected off of them the patch turns gold!
Pretty cool, check out the picture below that I took with flash.

Overall I loved these compression tights for when it's too hot for full length pants but you still want some compression on your thighs.
Bonus points if you throw on compression socks after your run to get the compression on your calves too!
