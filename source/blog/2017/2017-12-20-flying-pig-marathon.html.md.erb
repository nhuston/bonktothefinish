Growing up in Ohio I've heard of the Flying Pig race for many years.
Mainly the hills, and how they will either slow you down or beat you down.
So naturally I've stayed away from this race for a while.

2018 is going to be the 20th anniversary for the Flying Pig so I was convinced this had to be the year I ran it.

The Disney Dopey Challenge has it more popular to run multiple races in one weekend.
I love racing but am not exactly drawn to Disney, and was excited to learn Flying Pig will have multi-race opportunities.
Flying Pig offers all sorts of multiple race challenges, themed, surprisingly enough, around Skyline Chili.
I signed up for the Skyline Chili 4-Way challenge which consists of the 5k and 10k on Saturday and the marathon on Sunday.
Times from the three races are combined to get your overall place.

There is also an option to add "Extra Cheese" to the race by running a mile on Friday evening.
I might add this on later once I solidify my travel plans, but for now I am already going to have a full weekend.

And apparently there's talk of finisher's jackets?!
Don't sit around thinking about this race too long because it's on track to sell out this year!
