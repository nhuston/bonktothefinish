###Backstory

I ordered these lights right before my [Canal Corridor 100](canal-corridor-100.html) mile race.
Although I didn't begin testing them until after my ultra, I could see value in adding this to my ultra marathon drop box before I even tested them.

During the race my main headlight began to dim after several hours of use.
At first it was noticable but didn't make a huge difference.
With no crew, once I picked up my pacer at mile 66 I had no more access to my drop box.
From there on I relied on a combination of my (slowly fading) headlight, my second headlight that my pacer was using, and eventually the flashlight from my pacers phone.

After running with the phone's flashlight in my hand, it was pretty clear that I would benefit from a light lower to the ground AND something that could keep me hands free.

###Testing

     caption: "I brought my Knuckle Lights to Chicago. They worked well for an impromptu early morning run as I tried to get adjusted to the time change." } %>

Once my Knuckle Lights arrived my mileage was down dramtically as I took time to recover.
This worked out great because I could just go out to test the light in different areas/settings without my main focus being getting my runs in.
I found that these were even useful for taking my dog out for walks at night.
I could easily handle my 80 pound dog, her training remote, AND have a light.

I'm usually one to say that I wouldn't like running with handheld water bottles because I wouldn't want my hands full for an entire run.
It makes me worry they might get in the way if I were to trip.
I didn't get this feeling with the knuckle lights as they were very light and the bulk of the light is on the outside of your hand, not the inside palm.
My hands also almost had full range of motion with the exception of seperating your fingers.
The feeling was more like wearing a mitten than truely carrying.

The lights were also bright but gave off a surprisely blue light.
This matched my blue color choice.
The lights had a high, low, and flashing setting.
Also since they are waterproof runs in the rain aren't off limits!

###Results

I've found a new addition for my drop box for overnight ultras.
They are bright enough to use without a headlight, or in addition to a headlight if you are using the low setting.
I always find that it helps to have a light lower to the ground if you're running on technical trails.

Next up, [Brazos Bend 100](http://www.trailracingovertexas.com/brazos-bend-100/)!
I fully expect to use these more in the fall/winter during training as the days get shorter.
And finally, replace my old, not bright emergency back up [Petzl e+LITE Headlamp](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KYTR0HM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01KYTR0HM&linkId=fce96d2abbe02c15d092e1ec8536ac47) light that I've been using as a handheld light at longer races.
