Planning 2018 I knew I wanted to attempt another 100.
There's a few options I’m considering. 
Planning is complicated by a potential move across the country and thus any race will likely require travel.
That factors in potentially whole new level of stress on top of a long and difficult race.
Sounds fun!

**[The Pistol Ultra Run](http://www.pistolultra.com/) – March 17, 2018 - $155 until August 31, 2017**

I’ve had my eye on this race for some time now.
They moved the race from January to March this year.
Sadly with the date change it’s likely out for 2018 with [GDR](georgia-death-race-report.html) already on my calendar.

**[C & O](https://cocanal100.com/) – April 28, 2018 – Price TBD**

Heard this one has good vegan food and the course is similar to [Canal Corridor](canal-corridor-100.html).
The familiarity of the event would make it less stressful even if it has a bit more elevation change.
Only issue is it’d be pretty close to GDR, so for now it's a skip.
I’m comfortable with frequent 50ks but not quite as comfortable with sticking longer distance races close together yet.

**[Lighthouse 100](http://www.lighthouse100ultra.com/) – June 2, 2018 – $150 until August 9th, 2017**

I’ve heard good things about this race and would be interested in checking it out.
Unfortunately though, the window to sign up for the lowest price was pretty short and I missed out.
That’s before even considering travel cost and logistics.
I think I’ll pass on this one for 2018.

**[Canal Corridor 100](http://canalway100.com/) – July 7, 2018 – $150 until December 31, 2017**

This year it was my [first 100](canal-corridor-100.html).
Do it for the nostalgia.

**[UTE 100](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=49746) – August 11, 2018 – $250**

An obvious potential race.
It would be my first mountainous 100 but is described as being pretty and not designed to be the toughest.
It is also a Run Bum event.
After completing [Georgia Death Race](georgia-death-race-report.html) and signing up again to run in 2018, adding another Run Bum event to my schedule seemed like an easy option.

**[Western States](http://www.wser.org/) – June 23, 2018 – $410**

I qualified at [GDR]() this year.
Might as well throw my name in right?
If I get in I wouldn’t be able to pass up the opportunity.

**Run Across Ohio – FREE – May or September/October**

Make up my own race!
I like this idea, but logistically not sure if it will happen in 2018 if I move early.
I only have so much vacation time and a move would complicate things.
I've done the research and have the trails picked out.
Theoretically I could still run across whatever state I happen to be in, but moving will require a restart of the planning phase.
So this is up in the air as of now but still something I’d like to get to eventually, even if I have to change the location.

###Decision

I decided to sign up for the Ute 100.
It should be challenging and well worth the travel.
PLUS it comes with the option to defer your registration for one year if you get picked for a lottery 100 (like Western States) how could I turn that down?!
