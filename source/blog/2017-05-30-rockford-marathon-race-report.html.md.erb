For this blog post I'm going to try something a little bit different.
This marathon was James' 4th marathon.
I was along for the ride to keep him company and pace him to the finish.
But the race was all my idea.
So I'll present my side and [James](http://jarlowrey.com/) will present his to give a bigger picture of what this race looked like for a casual runner and a serial racer.

###The Sign-Up

Browsing Facebook I found a post that someone had mentioned the Rockford Marathon had special $26.20 pricing.
I like that this trend of cheap road marathons is catching on.
First the [Pro Football Hall of Fame Marathon](/blog/pro-football-hof-marathon-race-report.html) picked it up in 2017 and now this is the third race I've seen with $26.20 pricing!

When I found out about the pricing I checked my schedule.
I was in Chicago for two weeks for work and the race was the weekend sandwiched in between the two.
Perfect considering I needed to be close by anyways!

James isn't big into racing, but I can convince him to sign up when I find good deals.
I knew a marathon would be a tough sell.
When I called him he was with his brother trying to get a locksmith because they were locked out.
Perfect timing to get him to agree when he was busy and only half paying attention...
I pitched the idea, waiting, and asking for a reply.
It was probably something like "Sure babe, sounds fun," to get me off the phone.
I took the yes and ran with it and signed us up before he could change his mind.

###Lodging

We stayed at Rock Cut State Park for a cheap rate of $12 a night.
The drive was a bit far to the start (~20 minutes) but it wasn't awful.
The campgrounds were right on a lake which was scenic, however, at night you could hear the faint noises coming from the highway close by.
That took away from the peacefulness and beauty of the area just a bit.
It also got fairly cold at night considering it was almost the end of May.
We brought plenty of layers so it wasn't a problem, just not what I was expecting.

###Packet Pick-Up

The packet pick-up was laughably small.
It was located in a Fleet Feet that was under construction and hadn't opened yet.
It was very easy to get in and out with almost no wait.
I didn't mind it but I was hoping to buy an Illinois Fleet Feet singlet when I saw the location.

The race also had an option to mail your packets which was nice.
I haven't used this feature yet at a race but I debated using it here since I was traveling.
It's nice to see more races embracing this feature.

###Race Day

Parking wasn't hard to find but getting near the start was a bit difficult.
Google maps didn't recognize that certain streets were one-way.
This coupled with streets being closed for the race meant that it took a bit longer than expected to get across the river, but once we did parking was a breeze.

The half marathoners and marathoners started together at 6:00AM.
The race had Beast Pacing teams which helped the start be a bit more orderly.

The course was essentially 2 loops for the full marathon running parallel to the river (however the river was not in sight) before crossing and returning back alongside the river.
The stretch along the river was tough because it was open and there were not many trees or buildings to shield the wind.
This made for some tough miles as you were coming into the halfway point and then again in the several miles leading to the finish.

The race had "gels" but the packets were larger than normal sized gels and contained something more similar to concentrated gatorade.
The brand was called [Glukos](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017T02XIK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B017T02XIK&linkId=2806b1fccb6966c028af765ad3544c81) and on the label it stated that the gel was the official gel of the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon Series.
Some flavors were better than others but overall I wasn't a huge fan.
It would be great for someone who finds that gels sit heavy in their stomach, however I would prefer something less sugary.

I thought James could run a 4:45-5:00 marathon, so that's what pace I was trying to shoot for.
The 4:45 pacer was a ways ahead of us so I was just happy that we remained between the two pacers for most of the race.

After the halfway point the course emptied out considerably, and we were pretty much alone for most of the race.
We saw a few people here and there off in the distance or in passing, with one other runner that we were going back and forth with.

One thing that I was pretty unhappy about was that although we were on pace to come in well ahead of the 6 hour cut off, on the second loop some aid stations were empty or packing up.
When we finally did finish, I noticed that the finish line was being packed up as well.

**Final Time:** 4:54:42

So yea, way ahead of the 6 hour cut off and it felt like we were holding them up to leave.

###Race Collections

My only complaint about the shirts were that they were not gender specific.
Other than that though I felt like the shirt and medal were good considering the $26.20 price tag for the race.
