*Disclaimer: I received a free entry into the Honor Run Half Marathon as part of being a BibRave Pro. Learn more about becoming a [BibRave Pro](https://www.bibrave.com/bibravepro) (ambassador), and check out [BibRave.com](https://www.bibrave.com/) to review, find, and write race reviews!*

I just signed up for my first race as a [BibRave Pro](https://www.bibrave.com/bibravepro)!
The race starts and finishes under the Florence Yâ€™All water tower at Florence Mall.
All race proceeds benefit two great causes.
The first is Honor Flight Tri-State which helps send local veterans who have served our nation in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam to Washington DC to visit their memorials.
Second is Habitat For Humanity of Cincinnati that helps support local veteran home repair.
So it's for a great cause.

*Use code **"BIBRAVE10"** and recieve $10 off your registration fee!*

Also, each person that registers between now and May 12th for any Honor Run Half Marathon event will be registered to win a free guardian trip on a 2018 Honor Flight.

In addition, you get a shirt, a pretty awesome medal, and post race food and drinks.
See below!
Everyone gets the same medal regardless of distance.

The race has free parking and that's always huge for me, especially when I'm traveling to a race by myself.

Here's the course map for the half marathon:
