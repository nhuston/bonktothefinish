[10k done!](/blog/flying-pig-10k.html) The 5k was up next.

My original plan was to listen to the Up & Vanished podcast through the 5k as well, but my phone decided it would die instead.
I have only recently started running select races with my Aftershokz but I was so bummed.
Overall I was nervous for the next day's marathon and looking for an excuse to distract myself.

Lucky for me I stumbled across some friends between the end of the 10k and the start of the 5k.
I ended up running with one of them during the 5k which helped pass the time, something I desperately appreciated.
Also, as he was also working towards the 4-Way Challenge, he convinced me to run the 5k slower than I otherwise would have which helped keep my legs a bit fresher going into Sunday's [marathon](/blog/flying-pig-26.2.html).

The 5k felt bigger, or at least there was a lot more people passing me this time around.
I held steady on this race and DIDN'T speed up to pass people at the end.

During the 5k a light rain started, which really helped as the high humidity made it pretty muggy outside.
The rain was just enough to cool you off without getting heavy feet.

I thought the 5k was enjoyable and I stuck around to watch people finish towards the end.
The race started in waves so it felt like there was a never-ending mass of runners headed towards the finish.

The nice part about the 5k and 10k was that you had the option to pick up your race packet Saturday morning.
I flew into Ohio late Friday night (as I had to work that day) so there was no way I could have made it to the expo on Friday coming from out of town.
This was a nice touch that gave me one less thing to stress about.

From there I made my way to the Expo (to pick up my items for the marathon).
Everything was so close together, it was nice that I could easily park my car in one location for the 10k, 5k, and the race expo.

**Final Time:** 28:11
