Now deep into the winter months, my banana tree has spent several months indoors with plenty of natural light.
The tree seems to be growing surprisingly well in a container.
The roots are content for the time being.
See below for the tree compared to my 82 pound Belgian malinois.

It has also grown three more sister plants over the past few months.

I bought the tree back in May from Amazon.
When it arrived it was only a few inches tall.
Here are the 3.5 month, 5.5 month, and 7 month progression pictures.
(Viira for size!)
