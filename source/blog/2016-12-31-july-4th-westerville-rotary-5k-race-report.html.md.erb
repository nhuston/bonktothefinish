A week and 2 days prior, I had finished [Dawg Gone Long Run 50 miler](/blog/dawg-gone-long-run-50-race-report.html) with brutal blood blisters covering my feet and in between my toes.
After a few days of tending to my feet and biking, I was back on track and feeling surprisingly good.
I had originally planned to take this race easy due to how close it was to my 50, but I was feeling good and after a long run that weekend I had built my confidence back up.

Weather for race day looked perfect.
The forecast initially called for rain all day, but blew over.
I was left with an unusually cool summer day. Perfect race weather.
I was ready to crush this 5k and hoping to PR.
I went out and crushed the first 1.5 miles.
The next half mile my legs began feeling heavy and the soreness from my 50 mile came crashing down on me. I went straight into maintenance mode. I should have known that that I wouldnâ€™t be able to maintain that pace, but I was feeling overly optimistic.
I faded into the finish for a final time of 21:17.

I ended up placing 3rd in my age group and 9th female overall.
