I didn’t realize I needed these until a lovely volunteer placed them on my feet at mile 69 at [Georgia Death Race](/blog/georgia-death-race-report.html).
At mile 44.5, I blister that I had not felt up until that point popped, and suddenly sweat and dirt entered my skin causing stinging and tons of pain.
I limped into the mile 45 aid station (I was lucky that I was that close…) but no volunteers had band-aids or anything else on hand. I got my foot wrapped up with duct tape which worked surprisingly well.
When I came into mile 69, I decided to have my other foot looked at that had a much larger unpopped blister on my heel.
I cannot even begin to describe how heavenly my feet felt during the last 6ish miles after these were put on my feet.
When I returned to work these blister pads came in handy again, as I could wear flats pain free despite having blisters on my toes and heels.

If only I knew about blister pads back in my 2nd 50 mile finish at [Dawg Gone Long Run](/blog/dawg-gone-long-run-50-race-report.html)...

I find these to be a summer essential for me. Sometimes races carry them, but sometimes not.
They are perfect for when your stomach feels off and you aren’t feeling up to Gatorade or whatever other sports drinks that the race might carry.
I prefer drinking [Tailwind](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017GEK9QC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B017GEK9QC&linkId=96bc515f270e02464e2fc62f7e2a24f8) to taking S-caps, but when I run out or am not carrying water (i.e. road marathons) S-caps are life savers.
The hotter it is the more I carry, however this year at the [Pro Football Hall of Fame Marathon](/blog/pro-football-hof-marathon-race-report.html) I learned to carry extra in case the unthinkable happens and you drop one after mile 20 when you desperately needed one on a hot miserable day but are  too sore to stop and bend over + who wants to eat something off the ground.

Acetaminophen is the preferred pain reliever to take during exercise as NSAIDs such as Advil.
But typically races won’t carry any pain reliever at all.
I usually run with the maximum daily dose for emergency purposes in both marathons and ultramarathons.
I have taken it at Stone Steps 50k when I was running on a stress fracture in my hip.
I have also taken it to complete my first Ultra RAGNAR Del Sol relay where I ran 46 miles broken up into 3 legs when I was coming off of a knee injury that put me out of running for 8 months.
Sometimes it’s needed to make it to the finish when you aren’t quite ready to quit.
However, in general, I avoid taking pain relievers.

After doing some research into [caffeine water](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K8PHEYC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00K8PHEYC&linkId=ef62e42006d8a86d76e7efa6b4b3fb31) last year, I purchased a case to test out.
But I found them to have a slight after taste and overall thought they were a little bulky to use multiple times during an ultra.
Thus, this year before [Georgia Death Race](/blog/georgia-death-race-report.html), I bought caffeine in pill form.
Although the saying goes not to try anything new on race day, GDR ended up being 10 hours longer than I had ever ran at one time.
These caffeine pills did the trick to keep me moving through the night.
I would pop one whenever I noticed that I was tripping over rocks and running with my eyes closed.
The case I bought stated a recommended maximum daily dose, so I only ran with that amount for the race.
I also go cold turkey on caffeine leading up to a race, that was should I need caffeine, it will be more effective in smaller doses.

Although ginger ale is often available at ultras, I find that Gin Gins are more concentrated, and are great for an upset stomach when you screw up your nutrition.
Last year I DNFed at my first 100 attempt at [Burning River](/blog/processing-a-dnf.html). I screwed up my nutrition early and stopped eating: the deadly combination.
Then, a few months later I ran the Germantown 50k where I again found myself with messed up nutrition and began walking the third and final loop.
As more and more runners passed me, one runner struck up conversation and I mentioned that my stomach wasn’t feeling well and I was going to walk it off.
I thought I was going to walk the last 10 miles into the finish.
He handed me two Gin Gins and suggested I take one, and then another later if I needed before taking off.

The candy was chewy and coated my teeth and tasted pretty good.
To my surprise, shortly after eating the first candy my upset stomach was cured.
This stuff is miracles in candy form.
I also took  two at [Georgia Death Race](/blog/georgia-death-race-report.html), once to curb minor stomach issues at mile 30, and then later around mile 55, where I was tired and accidentally ate a potato that I dropped into a bowl of salt.
Instead of wiping off most of the salt or grabbing a new potato, I ate it.
It wasn’t long before I felt like throwing up.
It took a bit more ginger candy to cure this mistake, but after 5 long miles I bounced back. (without throwing up!)

I originally came across this product on a blog post that I can’t seem to track down now.
I have one of the older models.
The new model is 26 grams and 50 lumens.
Obviously it’s not the best option for your primary headlamp, however it is great for a backup.
With how lightweight it is I keep it in my pack, no matter if I’m running a day-time 50k or something longer.
It has an emergency setting for a red flashing light, as well as a regular headlight option.
I have been to races where runner’s batteries die and they are stuck running in the dark or trying to keep pace with another runner.

I have used it when my headlight is dying and slowly losing brightness as well as for a handheld light in addition to my headlight when the terrain is more technical.

###7. Extra Layer of Gloves –

In winter I always pack extra layers in my drop box, however after this past winter I have begun running with my extra gloves instead of keeping them in my drop box.
When the wind kicks up my hands seem to be the ones that notice it first.
And in the winter when you are cold it’s a long way back to your drop box.
I run with my giant [Earn Your Mittens](/blog/wisconsin-marathon-race-report.html) that I got from running back to back marathons in Wisconsin and Michigan.
The mittens are oversized and fit over any gloves that I have and easily add an extra layer.

Because my old [Garmin Forerunner 235](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0160BC1FO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0160BC1FO&linkId=f931daa93d227f3a13de638aca0409de) and new [Garmin Fenix 5S](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NBL9XGP/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01NBL9XGP&linkId=58ceea8bea7cc9d237cec0e7a0db37ef) watch only lasts for 12 hours on GPS mode.
This means at 50+ milers I typically run with a portable charger to keep my watch going.

Portable chargers are tricky to buy though, as they can quickly add weight to your pack and as such the smaller the better.

I picked up a small container of petroleum jelly at a marathon expo a long time ago.
Time went by and I forgot about it, but when I stumbled upon it again I realized it would be great to leave in my pack.
It’s great for the winter to protect your lips from getting chapped and prevent painful wind burn.
I find that I use it the most for the winter months, but it is also good to carry year round for potential chaffing issues.
