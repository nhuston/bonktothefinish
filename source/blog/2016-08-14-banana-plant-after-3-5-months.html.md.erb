I bought a tiny banana shoot from Amazon 3.5 months ago.
The plant was only a couple of inches tall at the time.
Today I realized it was outgrowing its 2nd container.
Time to repot!
I can only hope that this plant will one day keep up with my banana consumption (however unlikely that dream may be).

###After repotting: It already looks much happier!
