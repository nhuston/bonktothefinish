I've officially completed the Georgia Death Race.
The race report is coming soon, but first I felt like I should document my training.
Because what everyone is really interested in is: Could I finish something crazy like this or does she just have superpowers?
Disclaimer: I don't have superpowers and I doubted that my training would suffice every single day.

I trained mainly in Columbus, Ohio with no mountains or major hills to speak of.
I was also at the crazy low elevation of 902 feet.
Luckily GDR did not take place at elevation, but it did have 40,000 feet of elevation change throughout the 75ISH miles of the course.
(Note: I refuse to call it 68ish miles as the website states. On the elevation chart the miles went to 75.)

My training started January 1st.
The race date was April 1st - April 2nd.
I ran an easy fall 2016 season with some scattered 50ks here and there but no regular long runs to speak of.

In Summer of 2016 I had the big [Burning River 100](https://www.westernreserveracing.com/events/burning-river-endurance-runs-relay/) on my schedule.
It was my first and only 100 attempt to date.
I struggled to find and create my training plan and in the end I DNFed at Burning River dropping at mile 52.

The morning after my DNF at Burning River 100 I did something crazy and logged onto ultrasignup.
GDR registration was set to open that morning.
The race shut down ultrasignup.
I laid in bed clicking refresh on my phone for 46 minutes.
Finally my registration went through.
