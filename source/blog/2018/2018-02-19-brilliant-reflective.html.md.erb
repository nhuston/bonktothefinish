I've been a fan of Brilliant Reflective since I first tried them, [about 8 months ago](/blog/brilliant-reflective-strips.html).
The strips transform your current running clothes into reflective clothes!
Way better, and cheaper, than going out and buying expensive new reflective clothing.

There are two options - stick-on and iron-on.
I prefer the iron-on because I have so many running clothes that I can apply it to.
But the stick on is great too, it just requires a bit more creative thinking to decide what to apply it to.
They can be attached to any smooth surface, like a bike helmet.

###Iron-on

I don't actually own an iron, but luckily I could utlize hotel ironing boards.
The instructions say to put a paper towl between what you are ironing but I didn't have any.
Instead I used bath towels.
This worked pretty well, but I kept the iron in place a bit longer (since towels are thicker than paper towels) to make sure it would stick.
The strips all appeared as advertised, except the black strip which I thought looked more grey.

In the past 8 months since getting my first pack, only one article of clothing had to be re-ironed due to a strip coming off.
This time however, I had one pair of leggings that was difficult.
After only a few wears, one of the six strips on it needed to be re-ironed.
I couldn't really pin down *why* I had an issue but my guess was the fabric: leggings are smooth and stretchable, which may not be ideal.
After re-ironing there haven't been issues.
It's also possible I just didn't iron it for long enough the first time!

###Stick-on

I tried to have more fun with the stick-on colors this time around.

I had previously put Brilliant Reflective on my dog's collar, which I liked but in practice it wasn't a large enough area to really be useful. 
This time around I added an entire pack of red to the leash. 
This seriously helps keep my dog more visible at night.
The fact that my dog's collar is still reflective after 8 months of everyday use was enough for me to feel like putting an entire pack on the leash would be worth it.

I also put a pack on my bike. 
This is something I've been meaning to do and the blue matched the bike perfectly. 
Although after putting it all on, I can see myself buying more in the future to further cover the bike's large frame.
