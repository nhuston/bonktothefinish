Can you really have a 4th of July without grilling something?!

This year we opted for Beyond Meat Burgers after discovering them within the past year.
They are a bit pricey but if you compare them to higher quality meat options they are reasonable.

The main problem is simply *finding* the burgers.
If you can find a store that carries them, they are almost always sold out of the burgers and brats. 
Beyond Meat is in the process of TRIPLING their production because there's that much demand.

I usually avoid some of the more processed vegan options but considering it was a special occasion I went all out with Daiya American cheese slices and Follow Your Heart Veganise.

Other toppings included: tomatoes, mustards, pickles, banana peppers, artichoke hearts, avocados, and kale. I also cooked up some onions, green peppers, and mushrooms with a light seasoning of paprika, ground pepper and parsley.

The final product was so satisfyingly good!
