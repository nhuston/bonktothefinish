Hello readers!
This is James, Nicole's fiance.

Recently we become engaged and went through an interesting journey to find our wedding rings, and she asked me to write up my experience here.

Unlike [diamonds](http://diamondssuck.com/), [wedding bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_ring) have a long tradition dating back thousands of years. 
It also serves a good practical purpose of displaying 'relationship status' while not on Facebook, and a symbolic purpose of representing an endless union as a circular ring.
I was excited to be a part of that tradition with my very own. 

Originally I wanted something durable and scratch resistent, something that would go the distance.
I did not want to have to perform regular cleanings, replatings, or other maintenance. 
Being a bit absent minded, there's a non-zero chance I will eventually misplace or lose my ring, so I wanted it to be inexpensive as well.
Finally, it had to look good!
I didn't care about the material's rarity, color, astrological sign, etc it was as long as it mostly fit those requirements.

## Metals

The type of metal determines the look and durability of a ring.
There are many varieties available, much more than I had expected before I started looking.
The main ones are as follows:

| Material         	| Formula 	| Density 	| Mohs 	| Color        	|
|------------------	|---------	|---------	|------	|--------------	|
| Platinum         	| Pt      	| 21.45   	| 3.5  	| Silver-White 	|
| Palladium        	| Pd      	| 12.02   	| 4.75 	| Silver-White 	|
| Gold             	| Au      	| 19.30   	| 2.5  	| Yellow       	|
| Silver           	| Ag      	| 10.49   	| 2.5  	| Silver       	|
| Titanium         	| Ti      	| 4.51    	| 6.0  	| Silver       	|
| Tungsten Carbide 	| WC      	| 15.63   	| 9    	| Gray         	|
| Steel            	| FeC     	| 8       	| 6.0  	| Silver       	|
| Wood             	| C       	| 0.61    	|      	| Brown        	|
