So I'll start this with a confession.
In the past I've only worn headphones if I was going to the gym or at the airport or another situation where I want to block out noise.
I won't venture outside wearing headphones.
To me it just seems risky, why cut off my situational awareness?
Not to mention the countless trail races I've been to where screaming, "ON YOUR LEFT" is ignored by a runner wearing headphones.
I've also been to marathons where people run with their own boombox so everyone has to listen to their music whether they like it or not.

Then comes wireless headphones.
It seemed over the top to have to remember to charge headphones.
(Since this is a review I will point out that Aftershokz also offers wired headphones.)

I'd heard the raves over Aftershokz but really wasn't interested for the longest time.
Cheap headphones get me through the gym, no problem.
Why would I want to change my routine to remember to charge headphones?

###How They Work

All this time purposely avoiding the Aftershokz craze one day I overheard that Aftershokz uses "bone conduction."
I had no idea what that meant and went to research.
According to [Aftershokz](https://aftershokz.com/pages/technology):

>Bone conduction is a natural part of the hearing process—sound travels through our eardrums and bones simultaneously. We've taken the concept to the next level through development of a suite of proprietary audio technologies and design patents. The result: headphones that deliver unrivaled situational awareness and comfort.

>Transducers guide mini vibrations through the cheekbones to the inner ears, delivering sound without plugging or covering them.

So essentially these headphones don't go on your ears at all. 
In what I have decided can only be described as "magic," Aftershokz remove the major safety and etiquette issues that have led me to avoid headphones while on the run.

###I have ear piercings. Will this work for me?

I was worried about this too. 
I have my tragus and forward helix pierced and these headphones didn't bother me at all.
My tragus has flat jewelry while my forward helix has a ring.
No complaints here!

###The Verdict

I found these headphones easy to set up and connect with my phone's bluetooth.
They are super light and I have forgotten that I am even running with them.
I find that they stay on securely, even with my smaller head, and don't bounce around while running.

Additionally, I definitely put the battery to the test forgetting to turn the headphones off after use and figuring out how often to charge them.
I'd stay the battery life has lasted pretty well under the Nicole stress-test.
They are also forgiving of absent-mindedness with their fast charge time.

These days podcasts are becomming a larger part of my everyday routine, no longer are they just relegated to the gym.

The sound is hard to explain, with the volume settings you can turn it up high enough that it feels too loud but you're still be able to hear noises around you.
The headphones came with earplugs to use in addition if you are in a situation where you *want* to block out other noises, but for me I think I wouldn't use Aftershokz for this purpose.
I see Aftershokz as a safety headphones brand whereas if I'm on a plane I might opt for noise cancelling headphones.

Aftershokz has filled a headphones market gap that I have yet to see any other companies address.
