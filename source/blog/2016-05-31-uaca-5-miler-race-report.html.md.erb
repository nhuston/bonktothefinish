This race was purely a “fun” run that turned out better than expected.
The course had some hills and was warm but I got it done.
My race plan was essentially to do a medium-hard effort for the first three miles and switch to hard effort for the last two.
I wasn’t worried about pace for this particular race, just my perceived effort.
It took me about a mile and a half to find the effort level I wanted to start with.
Hills were scattered across the course which made it hard to gauge my overall pace during the uphills and downhill stretches.
The course was a part of Upper Arlington that I don’t typically run through, but did thoroughly enjoy.
Noted that I wanted to run in that area again eventually.

Before I knew it the mile 3 sign appeared.
I realized it was time to kick up the effort for the last two miles, however, I briefly tried to talk myself out of it.
Then someone tried to pass Mr and that was push I needed.
Looking at my HR, you can clearly see that my perceived effort strategy worked quite well with my HR jumping at the 3 mile mark.

I’ve been running with a watch again after teaching myself to run solely based on perceived effort for over a year.
Now it’s interesting to see how closely my HR mirrors my perceived effort.
Forget about pace, that stresses me out and is the whole reason I stopped running with a watch in the first place.

**Final Time:** 35:26

1st in my age group and 8th overall.
Unexpected and not bad.
