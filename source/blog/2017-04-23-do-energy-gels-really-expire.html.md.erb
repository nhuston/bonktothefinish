While running [Georgia Death Race](/blog/georgia-death-race-report.html) I noticed an unusual change in the consistency of my Power Gels.(add amazon affliate link)
They tasted a little grainy instead of the usual smooth consistency.
At the time I didn't think anything of it, but after running Forget the PR 50k two weeks laterI checked the date on my 2 remaining gel packs.
April 2017.
GDR was held on April 1-2nd so suddenly it came together.

My gels were expired.
I checked Amazon to see when I ordered the gels as I couldn't remember.
