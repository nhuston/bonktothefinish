###1.	Edit Your Work

Nothing looks more unprofessional than having errors in your blog post.
Mistakes will happen, but at least do a quick run through to screen for silly mistakes.
You want to build credibility with your readers and exhibit pride in your final product.

###2.	Check Your Title Capitalization

I use a quick check at [titlecaptialization.com]( http://titlecapitalization.com/).
This is also helpful for picture captions or topics in a list.
It takes less than 30 seconds.

###3.	Have a Friend Read over Your Post

Ask a friend read over your post for spelling and grammatical errors.
Bonus points if they give you feedback on your writing style and edit for clarity.

I have found this to be extremely helpful when writing posts.
You might have missed a run-on sentence or what you are trying to convey might not come across in your writing.

Sometimes your jokes aren’t as funny as you thought or a point could use additional explanation.
In turn, this will help broaden your audience.

Considering outside feedback will help you grow as a writer and improve future posts.

###4.	Preview Your Post

Don’t click publish before reviewing your overall layout.
Is that picture too big for the page?
Do all of your links work correctly?
Is there anything else in the layout that is distracting from your content?
If so, here is your opportunity to fix it.

###5.	Give Credit for Borrowed Content

Did you borrow pictures or stock images that belong to someone else?
Give credit where credit is due.
Again, this step adds credibility to your blog.
