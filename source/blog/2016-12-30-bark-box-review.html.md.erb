For Christmas I suggested that family buy a toy for my dog instead of getting me anything this year.
I ended up with a three month Bark Box subscription!
It was unexpected and a unique gift.
I didn’t know that you could buy a subscription as a gift until I received it.

I decided to show what I received each month for fun.
I’ll update this post as I receive more boxes.
I picked the large dog option since my dog is 80+ pounds.
Each box has a given theme.

###MONTH ONE

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "barkbox1-1.jpg",
    alt: "Viira with Bark Box's box"} %>

It's here!

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "barkbox2-1.jpg",
    alt: "Viira opening Bark Box's box"} %>

I usually let Viira attempt to open all of my packages, as long as there isn’t batteries or toxic items inside.
I guess she couldn’t smell the treats inside because she became uninterested rather quickly.

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "barkbox3.jpg",
    alt: "Bark Box's box opened"} %>

Seems to be a winter theme…

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "barkbox4.jpg",
    alt: "Bark Box toys"} %>

This box contained two toys: a stuffed party hat with a squeaker inside and a rope with two stuffed mittens that also contained squeakers.
There were 3 food items: a pork chew, mac and cheese favored treats, and prime rib flavored treats.
Yum!
The party hat toy was made of especially durable fabric.
The mittens less so, but it’d expect them to last for my dog.
Viira likes to rip stuffing out gradually over time, but I could see this toy being destroyed quickly by some other dogs.
The food all seemed to be decent quality as well.
No complaints from myself or Viira!

Balancing Viira’s new toy on her head. She’s all ready for New Years!

**MONTHS TWO AND THREE: PENDING. CHECK BACK SOON!**
