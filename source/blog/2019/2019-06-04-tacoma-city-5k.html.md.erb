I kicked off the Tacoma City weekend with the 5k. Nervous was an understatement for how I was feeling. I struggled to get ready in the morning and didn't want to get in the car. I doubted my fitness, as although I had PRed in the [marathon in February,](/blog/mesa-phx-marathon-recap.html) I took a slow pace getting back into it and had only ran one 50km since and a few halfs and shorter distances. Speed had been more of my focus. So here I was, and although I've ran a handful of back to back marathons or 50kms I was sitting there wondering if I would even be able to finish injury free or if I would time out on Sunday's 50km.

With all the doubt clouding my mind as the 5k lined up I found myself far from the  start line but somehow in front. No one wanted to line up at front. I looked around waiting for someone who looked like they belonged ahead of me, particularly females. But I didn't really see many people. I also kept in mind that I had to run a marathon only an hour later, so I knew I didn't want to race too hard (not to mention the 50k that was to follow the next day!).

The race stated and we all ended up having to run several extra steps to get to the start line. I decided I'd do a rough 80% effort. We turned out of Point Ruston onto the path by the water. It was early enough that the path wasn't too full which worked well for a 5k. Later on in the day the path was much fuller, making it harder to pass people but not as big of a deal since you were moving slower. The course was a quick out and back to a turn around, and I realized at the turnaround that there was a huge gap between me and the next few females. "Ok fine, maybe I'll race the second half a bit faster," I thought.

Running back was fun as people cheered me on and you got to waive at all the other participants. It reminded me of my usual weekend [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.us/).

The way back was a bit longer, as you took the path away from the road and behind all the apartments and businesses in Point Ruston before wrapping back around to the finish. This part teased you a bit, as you ran right next to a set of stairs that took you to the finish, but you had to keep going and climb a small hill before looping back to the finish.

I finished modestly with a very similar time as I'm used to getting at parkrun, so I was feeling good. I'm not sure if I ended up sticking to my 80% effort plan, but I did get a nice ribbon for my run and a few extra minutes of rest before the start of the ghost marathon.

**Final time: 22:16**
