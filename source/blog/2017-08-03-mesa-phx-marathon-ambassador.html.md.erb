###Discount Code: **BONKTTF10**

I’m excited to announce that I’ve been selected as an ambassador for the 2018 Mesa-Phx Marathon!
The race is Saturday, February 24th, 2018.
I will be returning to Arizona (finally!) after moving away back in 2015.
I miss the desert and their dry heat!

Check out my [ambassador bio](https://thephoenixmarathon.com/ambassadors/nicole-huston/):

February will be the perfect time to ditch my cold northern winter and spend some much needed vacation time in the sun.
Add running and you have the makings of a perfect vacation!

The course is fast too. 20.7% of the runners who ran the full marathon in 2017 qualified for Boston.
Even if you are not looking to qualify for Boston, the course is all downhill making it a good course to pick if you’re looking to set a PR.

Use my code **“BONKTTF10"** for $10 off the full and half marathon pricing for 2018.
Sorry 10kers, the code won’t work for you.
But don’t wait too long because this race has sold out every year since 2013.
And let me know if you sign up!
I’d love to know who else is racing.
