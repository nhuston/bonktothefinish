Doo Good 5k is now in the books! If you missed it, it's not too late to join this month's Scoobtober 5k/10k.

Simply pick your distance and if you plan on running with a pup pal or not!

This month's race includes a pup bandana and medal, a human medal, and a drawstring pack!

And remember, the race benefits [Best Friends Animal Society](https://bestfriends.org/).

Borrow a shelter dog if you need to get this done and make a new friend! (and maybe even bring one home!)

Viira is excited for this race because the distance is long enough to tire her out for a bit but short enough that she'll still want to play later in the day.

**If you still need to sign up the code "BIBRAVE" will save you 10%!**
