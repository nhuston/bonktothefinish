Coming off of my not so great showing at [Fore! Miler](/blog/fore-miler-race-report.html), I set out to do the Field of Heroes 5k as part of the Fleet Feet Race Club.

I showed up feeling sore and deflated, kind of wondering why I thought this would be a good idea.
I thought, “anything under 8:00 pace will make me happy today.
And if that doesn’t work out, well… oh well.
There’s no shame in walking races.”

I lined up in no man’s land behind the super fast group and then just ahead of the 8 minute pace sign.
I thought that the empty section between me and the start would fill up, but it never did.
I ended up inching my way forward just before the race start to fill the gap.

The race started and my pace already felt hard.
I passed another runner that notoriously finishes barely ahead of me who I’ve never beat.
This pace already felt like a mistake.
I was also my first time running with a watch since March 2015 (over a year!).
I didn’t dare to look down to see my pace as I figured I’d psych myself out.
I just kept going.
I realized that the course was somewhat similar to the First on the First 5k and felt somewhat relieved at the familiarity.
I passed decent chunk of people and thought I was doing well but wasn’t really sure where I was among females since I started so far back.
The last girl I passed was around mile 1.7ish and I figured there were plenty ahead of me.
I kept pushing until I got to a bridge where I misunderstood someone’s directions and almost crossed the street.
My concentration was lost at this point so I just focused on bringing it back and finishing strong.
The finish felt extremely far away in the humidity even though there was less than a mile to go.
I saw a pink singlet out of the corner of my eye and realized it was probably a girl behind me.
I kept pushing but also realized that I didn’t have anything left to give at this point.
If she passes me, ok, because I was going at an 100% effort at this point.

As we got closer to the finish people were yelling and cheering and someone mentioned that we were 1st and 2nd female.

**Final Time: 20:37**

For some reason I didn’t believe this, even upon finishing.
It wasn’t until I returned home to check the results for the race that I finally realized that I might have won the race.
I reloaded the results page numerous times the rest of the day, I guess still in shock that I managed to come in first.
I also PR’ed, a week after Worlds End, which had felt like it ripped every inch of muscle my legs apart.
It didn’t seem like the right week to PR, but that means I’m making progress towards one of my arbitrary first running goals to break 20, set 4 years ago when I started running and clearly thought that improving would be easy work.
