I recently bought some new supplements to add into my routine.
My daily intake consists of a multi vitamin, spirulina, fish oil, biotin, and ocasionally other things as well.
These are some of the new supplements I plan on testing out.

###L-arginine is good for:
1. Wound healing
2. Helping the kidneys remove waste products from the body
3. Maintaining immune and hormone function
4. Dilates and relaxes the arteries

###Krill oil is beneficial for:
1. Decreasing swelling
2. Lower cholesterol
3. Make blood platelets less sticky (When blood platelets are less sticky they are less likely to form clots.)

###CoQ10 is helpful for:
1. Boost energy
2. Improve recovery from exercise
3. Heart failure
4. Cancer
5. Muscular dystrophy
6. Periodontal disease
