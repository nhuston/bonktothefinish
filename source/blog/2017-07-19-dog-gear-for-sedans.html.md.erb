Often times, vacations include Viira.
As such I'd like to keep her safe during the long drives.
And protect the leather in my car.

I've put together a product list of what I use to "dog-proof" my vehicle.
I own a 4-door Honda Civic.

###1. [INNX Stretchable Back Seat Barrier](https://www.amazon.com/INNX-Stretchable-Barrier-Storage-Mini-Van/dp/B01M724OX6/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1484667918&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=DOG+BARRIER)

This is perfect for making sure my dog doesn't climb into the front seat of my car and claw up the center console.
It is also a safety feature not to have a dog in your face or obstructing your view while you are driving.

I've gone through several similar products that either didn't fit very well or did little to keep my dog out of the front seat.
This one works well and is easy to attach.
Additionally it is cheaper than medal per barriers that exist.

###2. [Paws 'n' Claws Dog Seatbelt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PWV17PY/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00PWV17PY&linkId=b81830ff8c28981a7729669efcd9940b)

This attaches to two headrests.
Because it is hung from a higher point instead of a seat belt extension for dogs that actually goes into the buckle, it is less likely for your pet to get tangled while traveling.

###3. [Kurgo Crash Tested Harness](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064ACNLO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0064ACNLO&linkId=87a316dd484764d279d8bf8d5cbb0499)

I've owned a Kurgo harness in the past but my dog grew out of it.
The quality of Kurgo's harnesses have improved dramatically since the first one I bought, and now their car harness is crash tested.
The only unfortunate thing is that the crash testing was only performed for dogs up to 75 pounds.
It'd be nice if the larger dogs could get some safety tests too.

###4. [Go Buddy Hammock Style Car Seat Cover](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019270UU6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B019270UU6&linkId=9479748c4a945ab30a2970120f0ea42c)

The sizing of this hammock car seat cover definitely fits a sedan better than large vehicles.
It is waterproof to protect your seats.
Additionally, it has two pockets for extra storage.
