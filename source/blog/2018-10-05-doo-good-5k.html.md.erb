So here it is! My big recap for the virtual 5k. I had big plans for my dog to run a speedy 5k with me.

I got her into top shape and doing some speed work with her. She was doing awesome and on track for our end of the month run.

And then... I got sick. I woke up on a Friday feeling off and went into work. Then I hear a coworkers talking about how he's been sick for 2 weeks, mind you with very similar symptoms as me. GREEEEATTTTTTTT.

It has been a long while since I've been sick so I guess it was about time. I wasn't expecting it to last until it did. I had originally planned to run the virtual 5k with my dog the weekend prior to a marathon I had scheduled. I had to push it back to the following weekend because I wasn't feeling great (that's the beauty of virtual races though!) In the end I ended up having to ditch my marathon too, which I think was my first marathon DNS ever.

So, Viira and I set off to slog through a 5k. It was clear that I was holding her back and she was running far from her max potential but I'm glad she humored me.

I could tell she was ready to go for the next month's 10k!

###Swag

As seen in the my [first post about this race](scooby-doo-virtual-run-series.html) This race included a t-shirt, dog bandana, and medals for the human and pup. The swag showed up a bit after the end of the month so it was a nice surprise when it arrived!
