I was offered to review Salmon Oil for Dogs (and Cats) from TerraMax Pro.
If you are interested in purchasing the product I will leave a link to the product [here.](http://www.amazon.com/Premium-Alaskan-All-Natural-Omega-3-Supplement/dp/B01BFPIETM)

We have all heard about the benefits of fish oil for humans, so why not feed your dog some as well?
I simply poured some over Viira's food.
She was able to smell it through the bottle and seemed very interested, so she would likely eat it plain as well.
It is easier to clean the bowl though if you just pour it over dry dog food.
Enjoy!

The product is 16 oz. and came with a flip top or a pump top. I chose to use the flip top.

Viira is already interested.

She seems to like it. Although I will not taste test to verify, I think this passed the test.
