I've been a fan of Brilliant Reflective since I first tried them, [about 8 months ago](/blog/brilliant-reflective-strips.html).
The strips are a cheap way to transform your preexisting running clothes into reflective clothes!
Way better than going out and buying expensive reflective running clothes to add to your wardrobe!

There are two options - stick-on and iron-on.
I prefer the iron-on because I have so many running clothes that I can apply it to.
But the stick on is great too, it just requires a bit more creative thinking to decide what to apply it to.

###Iron-on

I don't own an iron, but luckily utlized the iron in the hotel rooms when I was traveling to make this happen.
The instructions say to put a paper towl between what you are ironing but I didn't have any.
Instead I used bath towels.
This worked pretty well, but I kept the iron in place a bit longer (since towels are thicker than paper towels) to make sure it would stick.

I picked lots of black clothes to put the black strips on, but in person the strips looked more grey to me although the color on the package is called black.
In the past 8 months since getting my first pack, I can only think of one article of clothing that I had to re-iron a strip that was coming off.
This time however, I had one pair of leggings that I had to re-iron after only a few wears.
I couldn't really pin down *why* I had an issue but my guess was a combination of the fabric I was applying it to (smooth without much texture for it to bind to) and that leggings stretch a lot.
I re-ironed that pair and so far no issues, so it's also possible I didn't iron it for long enough the first time.
To put it in perspective I only had issues with one strip out of the 6 that I applied to that pair.

###Stick-on

I tried to have more fun with the stick-on colors this time around.

I had previously put Brilliant Reflective on my dog's collar, which I liked but in practice it wasn't a large enough area to really be useful. This time around I added an entire pack of red to the leash. This seriously helped with keeping my dog more visible at night.
The fact that my dog's collar is still reflective after 8 months of everyday use was enough for me to feel like putting an entire pack on the leash would be worth it.

I also put an entire pack on my bike. This is something I've been meaning to do and the blue matched the bike perfectly. Although after putting it all on, I can see myself buying more in the future for the bike because it could have used more with the large area of the bike.
