What is the best way to follow up an amazing workout or prep for an upcoming one?
Your food.

Healthy in = healthy out.
Easier said than done right?
You don't want to scarfice taste and convience is a major factor as well.

Meet Luvo Foods.
Frozen meals that actually taste good!
I found myself mainly bringing them to work for lunches.
They are portable and easy to prepare and better than convience food options.
There were a few times when I ate these meals at home but typically I was grabbing them to go when I was traveling.

##Luvo Meals: The Ranking

###1. Hawaiian Un-Fried Rice

     alt: "Luvo Inc. Frozen Meals Hawaiian Un-Fried Rice"} %>

I knew that the planted bowls would be my favorite.
They are vegan and packed full of flavor!
This was the only planted bowl I had at stores near me though.
I'm hoping to try more of these in the future.

###2. Farmer's Market Frittata

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
     url: "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KOBXZQG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00KOBXZQG&linkId=1665da82be26f12fecf9731c5ddd1862",
     src: "luvo-frittata.jpg",
     alt: "Luvo Inc. Frozen Meals Farmer's Market Frittata"} %>

I loved this meal!
Unfortunately Luvo has stopped making breakfast meals so I grabbed one of the last ones I saw.
The good news is that they've replaced the breakfasts with new meal options to try!

###3. Orange Mango Chicken

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
     url: "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KOBXZQG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00KOBXZQG&linkId=07bb0be8fffcc50aa2a123efa234a6a3",
     src: "luvo-orange-chicken.jpg",
     alt: "Luvo Inc. Frozen Meals Orange Mango Chicken"} %>

So good I bought it multiple times.
And I ate this for dinner the night prior to [Dawg Gone Long Run 50k](/blog/dawg-gone-long-run.html).
That should speak for itself!

###4. Tandoori-Inspired Spiced Chicken

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
     url: "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KIG3WJW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00KIG3WJW&linkId=59478236b2391aec23f348a15b1feccf",
     src: "luvo-tandoori-chicken.jpg",
     alt: "Luvo Inc. Frozen Meals Tandoori-Inspired Spiced Chicken"} %>

Unique and tasty!
I liked this meal because it felt like something I would have a hard time getting right if I tried to make it myself.
It didn't seem like something I would be able to easily replicate.

###5. Chicken in BBQ Sauce

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
     url: "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KIG3WJW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00KIG3WJW&linkId=66189a3c1303456737623a38ee6030d1",
     src: "luvo-chicken-bbq.jpg",
     alt: "Luvo Inc. Frozen Meals Chicken in BBQ Sauce"} %>

Honestly I wasn't over the moon to try this option.
I'm not a big BBQ fan.
BUT, the millet grits in this meal were so good!
I would probably buy these grits plain if they sold bulk packs of them.
It was that good.

###6. Red Wine Braised Beef & Polenta

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
     url: "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TRGHDG2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TRGHDG2&linkId=c79f893f769afd24b71d2e956923fb33",
     src: "luvo-braised-beef.jpg",
     alt: "Luvo Inc. Frozen Meals Red Wine Braised Beef & Polenta"} %>

I actually ate this meal before remembering to take a picture of it. *Gasp!*
But from the picture you can see what the meals look like after being removed from the microwave.
The steamable pouches remind me of popcorn bags as they have a note on them that says "This Side Up!"
If you bring these to work make sure you have a plate to transfer to!

The polenta was amazing. Luvo's millet grits and polenta outshined the mashed potatoe side by far.

###7. Roasted Vegetable Lasagna

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
     url: "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0146IOSWC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0146IOSWC&linkId=e9317da7cd9974138915e7dbe83bd420",
     src: "luvo-lasagna.jpg",
     alt: "Luvo Inc. Frozen Meals Roasted Vegetable Lasagna"} %>

Loved the veggie option for this meal but I think it could be improved by taking out some of the cheese.
It felt a little heavy to me.
Note that I typically do not eat much cheese.

###8. Turkey Meatloaf & Mashed Potatoes

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
     url: "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018SRHFO0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bonktothefi07-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B018SRHFO0&linkId=8b51bab774f3dac9b042dc77f3efc924",
     src: "luvo-turkey-meatloaf.jpg",
     alt: "Luvo Inc. Frozen Meals Turkey Meatloaf & Mashed Potatoes"} %>

This one was not as exciting as Luvo's other options.
That's not to say it isn't good, but it isn't as unique as a planted bowl or tandoori-inspired chicken.
This meal would be ideal for picky eaters or those who are not as adventurous.

I got this meal twice, the second time the meal had been redesigned slightly.
There were no longer massive brussel sprouts chunks in the meal.
They were replaced with collared greens.
This was an improvement in my opinion, although I try I still cannot seem to like brussel sprouts.

###Final Thoughts

In summary, I thought that these meals tasted fresh and had good variety.
Each meal was low in calories which is good for weight maintenance/loss.
However as I was reaching my peak training for my 100 miler, I found that I needed snacks in addition to these meals.

My favorite meal was the Hawaiian Un-Fried Rice bowl.
I wish stores near me carried more of the planted bowls.
I also heard good things about the Roasted Cauliflower Mac & Cheese.
Those are the meals still on my list to try!

Luvo now has an [online store front](https://shop.luvoinc.com/) where you can get free shipping if you order at least 15 meals.
This sounds like a great alternative to driving around town to try all the different meals that they offer!
