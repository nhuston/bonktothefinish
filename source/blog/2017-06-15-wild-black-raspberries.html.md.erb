This past week I went on a hot run with my 80 pound pup, Viira.
High humidity with temps near 80F.
It would be a toss up to see how far she'd run as last year she averaged 1-3 miles/day in the summer heat.

The run started and about 2 miles in I was searching for water so she could cool off.
To my surprise we found something better than water: wild black raspberries!

They looked like raspberries but because they were black I pulled out my phone to determine if they were edible or not.
I didn't find anything concrete but I did find [this website](http://www.realitysurvival.com/wild-berry-edibility-test/) to test if the berries were edible.
Eating wild berries is pretty risky but after following those steps and double checking the berries' characteristics on other websites, I felt confident these would be safe, and they were!

After verifying that the berries were indeed edible, I started picking!

Then I realized my shadow was staring me down.

Ok I guess I should share....

What a cool random find!
I was excited to find this secret spot less than 2 miles from my house in the middle of the city.

Oh... and Viira made it 5 miles in the heat! Must have been the wild black raspberry pit stop!
