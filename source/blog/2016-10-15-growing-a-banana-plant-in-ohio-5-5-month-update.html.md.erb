5.5 months ago I bought a banana plant off Amazon.
The plant is growing like crazy and has numerous sister plants growing at the base.
It was supposed to drop below freezing here so I figured it was time to bring my banana plant inside for the winter.
Today, I pulled some of the sister plants from the base and repotted one.
The others were ripped to pieces by the dog and used as mulch for the original plant.
